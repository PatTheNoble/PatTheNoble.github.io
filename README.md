    <h4> Repository Gallery </h4> 
    <p>
      A lot of the inspiritaion for my website was the idea for people to be able to easily view all of my top Github repositories, all in one compact place.
      The projects displayed are always up to date: they are fetched right from Github using the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest"> Github Rest API.</a>

    <h4> Efficient Visuals </h4> 
    <p>
      I love efficiency, and I also love nice, clean visuals. 
      Thanks to the svg file format, I did not have to compromise on either.
      The rotating gears on my site are efficiently made svg's which I have created myself.
      An svg is a vector image file format that can scale to any size without losing quality, and in my case, all within a few kilobytes.
      Further, the spinning motion is implemented with CSS animations as opposed to traditional video methods, saving large amounts of data overhead.

      This site is optimized for all sizes using media queries and responsive units.

    <h4> Security: </h4>
    <p>
      All interactions involving my Github Rest API key are handled through the server, allowing the retrieval of data without exposing sensitive information.
